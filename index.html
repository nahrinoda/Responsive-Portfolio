            <img class="headshot" src="./assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Photo of Nahrin Oda">I am a professional pirate hunter, and when I am not on a hunting mission, I am usually designing amazing jewelry using a special 3D program. I sell the blueprints to manufacturers who later 3D prints my creations and use these prints as their basic wax. 
          </p>
          <p>
            So basically, i am a creative pirate hunter, who likes to fix electrical ovans.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also designed other kind of products, such as: furniture, door knobs, light fixtures, buildings, interiors, handbags, cutlery, mugs, coins, and many more. I design 10 hrs a day and when my program does not respond as quickly as it should, I panic to say the least. 
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite activities are; fixing electrical home appliances and carpentry; so far, I fixed my heat-pump and electrical oven and re-decorated my entire condo. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in architecture (B.Arch) from the American University of Sharjah, worked as a Design manager for almost 10 years, before I morphed into a product/jewellery designer since the past 3 years.
